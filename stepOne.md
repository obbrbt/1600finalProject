# Step One: What the Heck is SVG?



Before creating an **SVG** image, let’s first discuss what the heck **SVG** even is. According to _Wikipedia_, “_Scalable Vector Graphics (**SVG**) is an Extensible Markup Language (**XML**)-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation._” [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).

Let’s break this down. **SVG** stands for **S**calable **V**ector **G**raphics. _Scalable_, meaning that it is easy to scale the image, _vector_ as the format of the image, and _graphics_ meaning, well, graphics!

E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage, or XML, is a markup language that is commonly used on the web and is both machine-readable and human readable. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

A markup language is any language on a computer that processes how text should be displayed. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language).

The purpose of **SVG** is to create images programmatically _without_ having to open up another software, such as *Photoshop*, to create an image.

In order to create an **SVG** image, you first need to create a document that can use SVG. For this tutorial, we’ll be using **HTML**.

But before we start, what the heck is **HTML**?
