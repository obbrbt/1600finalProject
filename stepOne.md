# Step One: Create a New File

The first step to creating an image using SVG is to find a suitable software in which you can create an html doucment. 

I personally use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). It's free and can be used on both Windows and Mac. However, if you are already familiar with a different editor, you are more than welcome to use that one. This tutorial will show examples using Brackets. If you're using a different editor, just replace "Brackets" with your software of choice.

The first thing you need to do is open up a new document in Brackets.

Before you do any editing, the first thing you want to do is save the file. You're going to want to the file with an .html extension.

Name it something appropriate for the assignment. I'm going to name mine example.html, but I recommend you name yours something like, "Dog SVG.html",
