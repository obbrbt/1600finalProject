# Creating a Dog **SVG** Image

So, now that you know the basics, let's make this image:

This is a "dog" I created earlier. It's a very simple looking polygon, but it has a lot of different points making it up. I created this image through trial and error. It's not the prettiest or doggiest **SVG** dog I've ever seen, but it's a good starting point. Maybe you can even make it look better!

To begin, let’s first set our **SVG** to be 300x300 pixels wide.

You can, of course, change the image to be whatever size you want. But if you want your image to look exactly like mine, I recommend creating yours to be 300x300.

Now, let’s start adding some points. The best place to start is the beginning, so the first point we will define will be the starting point of our image. This point will be the tip of the nose.

To place a point for the nose, use the coordinates (1,160), like this:

Before we start adding more points, I’d like to show you the live preview feature offered by Brackets. If you click here, you can watch your code in action. You may need to save it and reload the window before the image changes. You won’t start seeing an image until you have at least three points on your graph.



So far, your code should look like this:
