# Creating a Dog **SVG** Image

So, now that you know the basics, let's make this image:

![dogSVG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/24.PNG)

This is a "dog" I created earlier. It's a very simple looking polygon, but it has a lot of different points making it up. I created this image through trial and error. It's not the prettiest or doggiest **SVG** dog I've ever seen, but it's a good starting point. Maybe you can even make it look better!

To begin, let’s first set our **SVG** to be 300x300 pixels wide.

![300pixels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/25.PNG)

You can, of course, change the image to be whatever size you want. But if you want your image to look exactly like mine, I recommend creating yours to be 300x300.

Now, let’s start adding some points. The best place to start is the beginning, so the first point we will define will be the starting point of our image. This point will be the tip of the nose.

To place a point for the nose, use the coordinates (1,160), like this:

![firstPoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/27.PNG)

**Note**: *You will not start noticing any change in your live preview until you have at least three points to create a full image.*

Let's start placing some more coordinates on our image. We're going to continue on the bottom half of our dog's face. Place the points (1,210), and (25,230). 

Remember that when you add points to your polygon, you separate the x- and y-coordinates with a comma, and you separate each individual point with a space, like this:

![threePoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/29.PNG)

You should now start seeing an image in your live preview.

**Note**: *If you don't start seeing an image, save your code and reload the browser window. Sometimes the live preview only works after being saved.*

Great! You've started to make your first **SVG** image! Let's continue adding points.

The next two points will start drawing out the jaw of our dog. Add the points (50,230) and (75,230).

![fivePoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/30.PNG)

Your image should now look like this:

![fivePointsImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/31.PNG)

**Note**: *Again, if you're not seeing a difference, make sure to save your code and reload the browser.*

We're making some progress! Since these points are being placed on a coordinate, remember that the more subtle the difference between your points is, the more subtle the slope will be. 

For example, if you plot the point (1,10) and then points (2,11), (3,12), and (4,13) the slope between them...

![fourPoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/32.PNG)

...will be more subtle than the slope between the points (1,10) and (2,14).

![twoPoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/33.PNG)

So, with this in mind, if we want to create a rounded jaw, we should add more points.

Let's add seven points to make a more rounded jaw. You could add more to make it even more smooth.

The next points to add are (100,240), (125,245), (150,250), (175,252), (200,250), (225,245), and (250,230). 

![roundedJaw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/34.PNG)

This is what you should have so far in your live preview:

![roundedJawImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/35.PNG)

It's starting to look better as we continue!

**Note**: *If you want to round out your image more, make sure to put the points where they belong in order. Also make sure you're putting your points in the same order that I am. If your points end up out of order, your image will not be drawn correctly.*

Let's continue with the back of the head!

Add these four points: (275,200), (285,180), (300,120) and (290,90).

![backOfHead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/36.PNG)

![backOfHeadImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/37.PNG)

Looking good! Only a few more points to add.

Next up, the ear! Remember, the less points you add, the sharper your image will be. So if we want really pointy ears, you only need to add a few points.

Let's add three: (250,50), (210,10), and (200,90).

![ears](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/38.PNG)

![earsImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/39.PNG)

Almost there! Now, let's finish up our dog by rounding out its forehead and flattening out the muzzle.

Since we want a round head, let's add more points.

We're going to add these seven points: (160,90), (145,95), (130,100), (120,105), (110,110), (100,120) and (90,135).

![roundedHead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obbrbt/1600finalProject/main/images/40.PNG)

That's a lot of points! But our dog is complete!
