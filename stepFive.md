# Adding Color

Alright, so your dog is all done, but you think it needs a bit of flair. How about we change the color?

Changing the color is really simple! **HTML** provides a large library of named colors that you can use in your **HTML** documents. *W3Schools* has a nice list of all the named colors you can add [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).

You're also not limited to these colors! If you want more precise colors, you can add colors with *RGB*, *HEX*, *HSL*, *RGBA*, or *HSLA* values! *W3Schools* has references on how to add different color values [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp).

I've decided that I want my dog to be purple.

All you have to do to add color to your dog is add the "fill" attribute to your **&lt;polygon>** tag.

Remember, attributes are not contained within quotation marks but their values are. For example, remember how you placed points on your polygon. Within the opening tag of your **&lt;polygon>** tag, you added:

So, to add the fill attribute, mimic this.

Add your color within these quotation marks:

Your code should look like this (with your chosen color):

And your dog should now be colored!

All done! It looks great!
